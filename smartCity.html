    <p>Just as the world looks to Silicon Valley to provide the most creative, impactful technologies to disrupt industries
    and transform lifestyles, so too can San José become a global leader for civic innovation. Becoming a “smart city”
    means that game-changing technologies and data-driven decision-making will drive continuous improvement in how City
    Hall serves our community, and to promote concrete benefits in safety, sustainability, economic opportunity, and
    quality of life for our constituents.</p>

    <p>3. <span style=" font-weight: bold;">Provide oversight and policy guidance: </span>Create accountability through
