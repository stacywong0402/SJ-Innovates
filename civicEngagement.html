        <p>The Mayor’s “Unleash Your Geek” initiative has roots in the belief that San Jose’s people are its greatest asset.
        By harnessing the intellectual power of our community, we can innovate our way to a more efficient City, and in
        areas that don’t normally receive much new thought. In May of 2016, the Mayor launched the first “Unleash Your
        Geek” opportunity to challenge residents to create a technology solution to make graffiti abatement more
        efficient. Currently, removing graffiti from overpasses, freeway signs, and sound walls is labor intensive and
        expensive. Clean up requires the closure of freeway lanes, large bucket cranes, and dozens of city and state
        personnel. The City received 140 submissions and is now in the process of choosing finalists that will be given
        funding and incubator space to develop a working prototype of their proposal.</p>
