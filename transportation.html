        <br>
        <p>San Jose has paved the way for tomorrow’s transportation by creating a space for innovation, demonstration
        and partnership. San Jose’s story started nearly a decade ago when the city became created a “Technology
        Demonstration Partnership Policy” to give companies access to its facilities for pre-commercial technology
        demonstration.</p>
        <div style="height:15px;font-size:15px;">&nbsp;</div>
        <p>Quickly, innovators’ demand for the space in became clear: this policy led to the demonstration of 16 new
        clean tech projects, including the first-ever solar-powered electric vehicle charging stations.</p>
        <div style="height:15px;font-size:15px;">&nbsp;</div>
        <p>We built on this model with an approach focused on transportation.</p>
        <div style="height:15px;font-size:15px;">&nbsp;</div>
        <p>Silicon Valley innovators asked for the ability to develop transportation technologies in a real-world
        setting. In response, we founded our non-profit partner, ProspectSV, and launched a “Technology
        Demonstration Center” in 2014.</p>
        <div style="height:15px;font-size:15px;">&nbsp;</div>
        <p>This $12 million, 23,000 square foot Technology Demonstration Center provides workspace and resources for
        local technology companies to innovate and demonstrate cutting-edge technology. The Center is home to two
        labs: The Intelligent Traffic Systems Lab (ITS Lab) provides hardware and software tools to test advanced
        technology related to concepts like traffic flow management. The SimLab provides a simulator with a real car
        and a 220-degree multi-screen surround view to create an immersive virtual environment to test cutting edge
        concepts in transportation that require compliance with National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
        guidelines.</p>
        <div style="height:15px;font-size:15px;">&nbsp;</div>
        <p>These projects, and the many more tested in ProspectSV, allow for the technology reshaping our world to get
        its start in San Jose and demonstrate how we create outside structures to incubate innovative solutions.</p>

        <br>
        <p>In 2014, we created a “Transportation Innovation Zone” located in North San Jose that offers a multi-mile network
        of streets, signals, and infrastructure as a platform for technology innovators. With 21 traffic signals, over
        670 streetlights and standard public transit infrastructure – this zone serves as the perfect playground to
        develop tomorrow’s self-driving vehicles, automated traffic enforcement systems, vehicle to infrastructure tools,
        streetlight innovations, traffic sensors and more.</p>
        <div style="height:15px;font-size:15px;">&nbsp;</div>
        <p>The TIZ has attracted corporate partners across Silicon Valley: Cisco and partners are testing new
        Vehicle–Infrastructure communications technology employing Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) and
        traffic analytics approaches; Phillips is installing Smart Poles, that allow for enhanced cellular
        communications, and employ PG&E wireless Smart Meter technology; BMW and Toyota use traffic signal data feeds to
        test smart vehicle applications; and leading technology companies are helping us build an autonomous vehicle zone
        to accelerate the next wave of evolution in how we get around. Innovation like this is moving us towards our goal
        of becoming the premier global hub of urban technology innovation for smart cities.</p>
        <div style="height:15px;font-size:15px;">&nbsp;</div>
        <p>We invite you to test your innovation and get them ready for market here in the nation’s leading hub for
        tomorrow’s transportation. Contact shireen.santosham@sanjoseca.gov for more information</p>
